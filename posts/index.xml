      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hi&#34;&gt;Hi.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Joe, I like making games, and I hate making websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 2006 in the UK, I like to program games and various software for people to use and tinker with, I primarily use Godot for game development however, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started learning SDL3 with C++, using it to create my own basic game engine, for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning how to program since I was young (about 8 or 9 years old), and haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped programming since. I started learning game development using Godot about 4 years ago, and now worked on various projects, with large teams, working on some fan-games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
